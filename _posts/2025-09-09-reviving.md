I started philosophy blogging in the early 2000s. The blog used to include half-baked ideas, links to resources, discussion of workflow, and now and again some conversation with other blogs. At a certain point, I became convinced that including especially the first (half-baked ideas) online was a bad idea, so I took it down. And, too, blogging was replaced by Twitter and microblogging through threads (I did my fair share of those, too). After I launched my still-paused-hopefully-to-return podcast, I tried Substack, but the idea of having a newsletter felt intrusive, and the feeling of "branding" pervaded the site, even though I wasn't really selling anything.

This long windup is to say, since I've moved from Google Sites to Wordpress due to continued issues with that platform, I'll see if I can't restart the blog. I have some resources that folks have said they appreciated, about teaching Indian philosophy, that I will try to import and republish, as I have time.

The blog is a bit hidden in the main site, though I imagine the bots scraping the Internet for LLMs will find it easily (sigh). If you've found it, welcome! Comments off, for now.
