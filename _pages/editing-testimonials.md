Below are some testimonials from academics who have worked with me, whether as paying clients or through my role as Book Review Editor at *Philosophy East and West*.

> Malcolm is a wonderful editor and extremely professional in his execution of being an editor. He is sensitive to content, grammar, and style across a variety of disciplines, and he is knowledgeable about how to convey content in an accessible way across levels of academic and non-academic writing. Working with him is always a positive experience.

Anand Vaidya, Professor of Philosophy

> I found my experience of working with Malcolm Keating to be excellent. I wrote a book review for Philosophy East and West, where he has been working as an editor for some time. He communicated his expectations to me clearly and was prompt and helpful in answering my questions. He also provided helpful feedback on my review which strengthened it. Since its publication, I have received feedback from readers (including the author of the book that I reviewed) indicating how helpful they found my review to be. I believe that Malcolm's role in the editing process helped to make my review as successful as it has been, and I am grateful. It was a pleasure to work with him.

Jeffery D. Long Carl W. Zeigler Professor of Religion, Philosophy, and Asian Studies*

> Overall, Prof. Malcolm Keating's ability in philosophical reasoning and knowledgeability sets him apart as an editor in philosophy. His mastery of language, attention to detail, and ability to engage with complex philosophical arguments and ideas are truly exceptional, and I highly recommend him to anyone seeking an editor with a strong background in philosophy.

Chong Fu, DPhil Student of Indian Philosophy

> Malcolm helped me improve a difficult, complicated, and long book review. He added real value to the review, encouraged me to expand and clarify in various ways, and was in general a great pleasure to work with. Highly recommended!

Monte Johnson, Professor of Philosophy 

> I had an wonderful experience working on my article with Malcolm....In addition to focusing on grammar and style, Malcolm also asked important questions that needed clarity. With Malcolm's help, I could express myself better, and the quality of the paper was more professional than the first draft I submitted.

Upali Sraman, Lecturer of Buddhist Languages and Cultures 

> Malcolm is a very helpful editor. His general comments sharpened the piece I wrote for him in his capacity as an editor at *Philosophy East and West*. He also caught various small formatting inconsistencies and brought the piece up to the journal's requirements. (His ability to proofread Sanskrit is quite valuable, too!) Malcolm is also encouraging, punctual, and easy to communicate with. I'm happy to be working with him again, and I'd highly recommend others do so, too!
