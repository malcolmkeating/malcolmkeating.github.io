Drop-in office hours & appointments

During spring 2026, you can stop into my office in Wright Hall, Room 222, at any time during my "drop-in" hours, without an appointment:
* Tuesdays, 4:15–5:15pm

If these times don't work, make a [Google Calendar appointment](https://calendar.app.google/6vGQCxrU93EXe7cd9). If you need a time different from "drop-in" office hours and the online appointments, email me at <mkeating@smith.edu>.

Courses
======
### Spring 2026

**PHI 127: Introduction to Indian Philosophy**
An introduction to the two-thousand-odd years of philosophy on the Indian subcontinent, focusing on central texts and topics: the nature of self, mind, and reality; knowledge and its acquisition; morality and meaning; language and aesthetics. Students will read selections of primary texts in translation, such as the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, Milinda’s Questions, the Nyaya Sutras, and others. The course focuses on premodern Indian philosphy but includes some modern Indian thought, especially that which reflects on the relationship between modern and traditional ideas in the subcontinent.

**PHI 258: Topics in Philosophy of Language – Feminist Philosophy of Language**
Feminist philosophy of language in the analytic tradition seeks to understand how language may contribute to gendered patterns of oppression. It also proposes interventions to disrupt that oppression. This class surveys major topics in feminist philosophy of language, for example, the semantics of generics like “man” or “woman,” the meaning of slurs, the silencing effects of speech, the influence of gendered metaphor, the grammatical encoding of gender into natural language, and more. Students will read both foundational and contemporary works of analytic philosophy.
