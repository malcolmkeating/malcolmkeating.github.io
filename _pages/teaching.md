Drop-in office hours & appointments
======
During spring 2026, you can stop in to my office in Wright Hall, Room 222, at any time during my "drop-in" hours:
* Tuesdays, 4:15–5:15pm
* Wednesdays, 1:00–2:00pm

If these times don't work, make a [Google Calendar appointment](https://calendar.app.google/6vGQCxrU93EXe7cd9). If you need a time different from office hours and the open appointments, email me at mkeating@smith.edu.
