Courses
======
### Spring 2026

**PHI 127: Introduction to Indian Philosophy**
An introduction to the two-thousand-odd years of philosophy on the Indian subcontinent, focusing on central texts and topics: the nature of self, mind, and reality; knowledge and its acquisition; morality and meaning; language and aesthetics. Students will read selections of primary texts in translation, such as the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, Milinda’s Questions, the Nyaya Sutras, and others. The course focuses on premodern Indian philosphy but includes some modern Indian thought, especially that which reflects on the relationship between modern and traditional ideas in the subcontinent.

**PHI 258: Topics in Philosophy of Language – Feminist Philosophy of Language**
Feminist philosophy of language in the analytic tradition seeks to understand how language may contribute to gendered patterns of oppression. It also proposes interventions to disrupt that oppression. This class surveys major topics in feminist philosophy of language, for example, the semantics of generics like “man” or “woman,” the meaning of slurs, the silencing effects of speech, the influence of gendered metaphor, the grammatical encoding of gender into natural language, and more. Students will read both foundational and contemporary works of analytic philosophy.

### Fall 2026 (scheduled, subject to change)
**PHI 253: Topics in Indian Philosophy: Buddhists and Brahmins**
Buddhists and brahmanical thinkers were frequently philosophically at odds with each other in premodern India. They disagreed over what reality is and how we can know it as well as how we can think and talk about it. This course focuses on key debates between these groups in order to appreciate the range of positions within both Buddhist and brahmanical philosophy. Topics may include: whether there is a self or a God, what words refer to, what we can know through language, the relationship between language and inference.

**PHI 262: Meaning and Truth (scheduled, subject to change)**
This course is an introduction to central topics in the philosophy of language. What is the relation between thought, language and reality? What kinds of things do we do with words? Is there anything significant about the definite article "the"? How does meaning accrue to proper names? Is speaker meaning the same as the public, conventional (semantic) meaning of words? Is there a distinction between metaphorical and literal language? We explore some of the answers that philosophers like Frege, Russell, Strawson, Donnellan, Austin, Quine, Kripke and Davidson have offered to these and other related questions. Prerequisite: PHI 101, PHI 102 or equivalent

### Spring 2027 (scheduled, subject to change)
**PHI 233: Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art**
This course focuses on two overlapping clusters of philosophical questions. We consider aesthetic problems like: What is beauty? How do we experience it, and where—in nature, in art, in ordinary objects and activities? Are there objective standards for aesthetic judgments? In philosophy of art, we consider problems like: What makes something a work of art? What is art for? Do artists have moral responsibilities and can art cultivate our moral sensibilities? Readings will be from worldwide philosophical traditions. Assignments will involve extensive use of the resources of the Smith College Museum of Art.

**PHI 112: Chinese Philosophy**
Introduction to some of the canonical texts and most influential ideas in the early Chinese philosophical schools, including those of Confucius, Mencius and Zhuangzi. Questions to be covered include: What is the nature of reality? How can we know what is the right thing to do? What is the self? How important is the family and obeying parents and guardians? Is there such a thing as "human nature?" Does anyone have access to the truth? How should one understand the relationship between humans and the natural world? Enrollment limited to 30.
