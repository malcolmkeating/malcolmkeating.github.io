### Welcome! ###

I'm Associate Professor of Philosophy at [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/), Northampton, MA, USA. My research is historical and analytic. I think along with early Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā philosophers about how words acquire different meanings in context, how metaphors and figurative language work, how we talk about nonexistent entities, and more.

**Smith students**, use this link to make an appointment, request letters of recommendation, and more.

I have a **blog** that I update now and again and a **podcast** that I hope to revive someday.

I'm also a **freelance editor**, with a copyediting certificate underway from UC San Diego Extended Studies.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/c_malcolm/), and spending time with my partner, also a [philosopher](https://sites.google.com/site/laurapaceguerrero).

Note: This is a GitHub Pages version of my academic website, which I'm using to play around with Markdown and other projects. If you've stumbled across it accidentally, you probably want my [active website](https://malcolmkeatingsite.wordpress.com/).
