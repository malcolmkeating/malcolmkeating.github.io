I am Associate Professor of Philosophy at [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/), Northampton, MA, USA.

At Smith, I teach in the [philosophy department](https://www.smith.edu/academics/philosophy) and advise philosophy majors, [linguistics majors](https://www.smith.edu/academics/linguistics), and [South Asian studies minors](https://www.smith.edu/academics/south-asian-studies).

In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/c_malcolm/), and spending time with my partner, also a [philosopher](https://sites.google.com/site/laurapaceguerrero).

This is a GitHub Pages version of my academic website, which I'm using to play around with Markdown and other projects. If you've stumbled across it accidentally, you probably want my [active website](https://malcolmkeatingsite.wordpress.com/).
