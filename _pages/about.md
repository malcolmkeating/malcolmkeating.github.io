### Welcome! ###

I'm Associate Professor of Philosophy at [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/), Northampton, MA, USA. My research focuses on premodern philosophy in the Indian subcontinent. I think along with early Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā philosophers about philosophy of language, epistemology, and argumentation. You can see my [academic CV](https://malcolmkeating.github.io/cv/) or go to my [PhilPapers](https://philpeople.org/profiles/malcolm-keating) profile for more about my work.

**Smith students**, use this [page](https://malcolmkeating.github.io/teaching/) to make an appointment, request letters of recommendation, and find out which courses I'm teaching.

I have a **blog** that I update now and again and a **podcast** that I hope to revive someday. The blog is mostly about Indian philosophy and technical/editing topics.

I'm also a **freelance editor**, with a copyediting certificate underway from [UC San Diego Extended Studies](https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/courses-certificates/writing/copyediting). If you're interested in working with me, see my **editing page**.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/c_malcolm/), and spending time with my partner, also a [philosopher](https://sites.google.com/site/laurapaceguerrero).

Note: This is a GitHub Pages version of my academic website, which I'm using to play around with Markdown and other projects. If you've stumbled across it accidentally, you probably want my [active website](https://malcolmkeatingsite.wordpress.com/).
