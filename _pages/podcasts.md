### Sutras & Stuff

[Sutras & Stuff](https://open.spotify.com/show/5Gsa7e9VGL7DKjH26deaNG) is a podcast that I began during the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

Episode 1: Threads compared the *sūtra* style of Indian thought to Twitter (Sadly, the episode appears to be missing from Spotify right now). Season 2 focused on Nyāya epistemology. Season 3 discussed teaching Indian philosophy with faculty from Yale-NUS College. Season 4 took listeners into Indian philosophy through Sanskrit loanwords. That season has been paused, but I hope to continue at some point in the future.

### New Books Network

For several years, I have been a podcast host at the New Books Network, both independently and, for a time, with the New Books: Philosophy podcast. You can find episodes I’ve recorded collected [here](https://newbooksnetwork.com/hosts/profile/d47e3b96-c1b7-487f-8351-09341b71fb0d).
